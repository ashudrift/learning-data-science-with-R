 ## Defination of Data 
 
    Data are values of quantitative and qualitative variables, belonging to a set of items.
    Data classified as Raw data and Processed data.
      1. Raw Data -  * Original source of data
                     * Hard for analysis
                     * Includes processing for 1 or more time.
      2. Processed
         Data     -  * Data ready for analysis
                     * Processing may include subsetting,transforming,merging,etc.
                     * There may be standards for processing.
                     * All processing steps must be recorded.

 ## Tidy Data
 
                ### 4 must things to have going from Raw data to Tidy Data
                
                    *  The Raw Data
                    *  The Tidy Data
                    *  Code book(Metadata) describing each variables and its values in Tidy Data.
                    *  An explicit and exact reciepe to have when going from Raw to Tidy Data.

 ## Principles of Tidy Data
              
                    *  Each and only one variable in one column.
                    *  Each different observation of variable in different column.
                    *  1 table for each kind of variable.
                    *  If multiple tables include a column to link them.
                    
 ### Additional Tips
                 
                    *  Include a row at top with variable names
                    *  Make variable names human readable.
                    *  Data saved in one file per table. 
                    
 ## About codebook
            
                    *  Information about the data in raw data (variables and units).
                    *  Information about summary choices
                    *  Study Design - The expeimental setup on how data was collected.

 ## The Instruction List -- A Rscript or other format file that has codes to extract the tidy/processed data                             from the raw data exactly in same format.
 
                    *  Input is Raw Data
                    *  Output is Tidy Data
                    *  There are no parameters to fix by user
                    *  If use another software then write exact steps and software used.
